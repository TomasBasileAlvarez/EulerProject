Notebooks with some of the programming questions and solutions from Project Euler
https://projecteuler.net/

According to its web page, Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

In this repository I solve some of the problems in project Euler
